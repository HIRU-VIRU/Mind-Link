# 🎉 SUCCESS! You're Enrolled in EPP!

## Current Status

✅ **Enrolled in Google's Early Preview Program (EPP)**  
✅ **Chrome Built-in AI APIs will be accessible once model downloads**  
✅ **Extension code is ready and migrated**  
⏳ **Waiting for model download in EPP profile**

---

## What Happens Now

### Step 1: Monitor Model Download ⏱️

The "Optimization Guide On Device Model" is downloading in your EPP-enrolled Chrome profile.

**To check progress:**
```powershell
# Run this script:
& "d:\Projects\Mind-Link\test-epp-profile.ps1"

# Then choose option 1 to open chrome://on-device-internals/
```

**Or manually:**
1. Open Chrome (in your EPP profile)
2. Go to: `chrome://on-device-internals/`
3. Look for "Foundational model state"
4. Wait until it says: **"Ready"**

**Download details:**
- Model: Gemini Nano (v3Nano)
- Size: ~1.5-2 GB
- Time: 5-30 minutes (depends on internet speed)
- Location: Will be saved in EPP profile's user data folder

---

### Step 2: Test API Availability ✅

Once model shows **"Ready"**, test the APIs:

**Quick test:**
```powershell
& "d:\Projects\Mind-Link\test-epp-profile.ps1"
# Choose option 2 to open test page
```

**In the test page, you should see:**
```json
{
  "self.ai": true,  ← Should now be TRUE!
  "self.ai.languageModel": true,
  "self.ai.summarizer": true,
  "self.ai.translator": true,
  "self.ai.languageDetector": true
}
```

**Test the buttons:**
- Click **"Test Prompt API"** → Should generate a response
- Click **"Test Summarizer API"** → Should create a summary
- Click **"Test Translator API"** → Should check translation availability

---

### Step 3: Load Your Extension 🚀

Once APIs work in the test page:

1. **Open Extensions page:**
   ```powershell
   # Run the test script and choose option 3
   & "d:\Projects\Mind-Link\test-epp-profile.ps1"
   ```

2. **Enable Developer Mode:**
   - Toggle "Developer mode" in top-right corner

3. **Load Your Extension:**
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Navigate to: `d:\Projects\Mind-Link`
   - Click "Select Folder"

4. **You should see:**
   ```
   PhishGuard Vision
   Version 2.0.0
   ID: [some-extension-id]
   ```

---

### Step 4: Test Extension Features 🎯

Once loaded, test all the migrated features:

#### Feature 1: Page Summarization
1. Visit any website with lots of text
2. Extension should auto-summarize or provide summary option
3. Check console for "[Mind-Link]" logs

#### Feature 2: Word Dictionary
1. Double-click any word on a webpage
2. Should show AI-powered definition
3. Uses Prompt API

#### Feature 3: Phishing Detection (NEW!)
1. Visit any website
2. Extension analyzes for phishing indicators
3. Shows warning overlay if suspicious
4. Displays trust score (1-5 stars)

#### Feature 4: Jargon Simplification (NEW!)
1. Select complex text on any page
2. Press: **Ctrl+Shift+S**
3. Text should be simplified
4. Uses Rewriter API (or Prompt API fallback)

#### Feature 5: Ad Learning & Blocking
1. Browse websites with ads
2. Extension learns ad patterns
3. Blocks ads dynamically
4. Check background script logs

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### APIs Still Show False After Download

**Solution 1: Reload Everything**
```powershell
# Close Chrome completely
Get-Process chrome* | Stop-Process -Force

# Reopen in EPP profile
Start-Process "chrome.exe" -ArgumentList "file:///d:/Projects/Mind-Link/test-chrome-138-apis.html"
```

**Solution 2: Check Flags (Probably Not Needed with EPP)**
Go to `chrome://flags` and verify:
- `prompt-api-for-gemini-nano` → Enabled
- `summarization-api-for-gemini-nano` → Enabled
- `optimization-guide-on-device-model` → Enabled BypassPerfRequirement

### Extension Errors

**If you see "Chrome AI not available":**
1. Check that model is "Ready" at `chrome://on-device-internals/`
2. Reload extension at `chrome://extensions`
3. Check browser console (F12) for detailed errors
4. Make sure you're in the EPP-enrolled profile

**If features don't work:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for "[Mind-Link]" logs
4. Share error messages with me

### Wrong Chrome Profile

**EPP enrollment is per-profile!**
- Check which profile you're using (top-right corner avatar)
- Switch to the EPP-enrolled profile
- Chrome > Settings > You and Google > Shows EPP status

## 📋 Quick Reference

### Useful Chrome URLs
```
chrome://on-device-internals/      ← Model download status
chrome://extensions/               ← Load extension here
chrome://flags/                    ← Enable flags if needed
chrome://version/                  ← Check Chrome version
```

### Useful Commands
```powershell
# Test EPP profile (interactive menu)
& "d:\Projects\Mind-Link\test-epp-profile.ps1"

# Open test page directly
Start-Process "chrome.exe" -ArgumentList "file:///d:/Projects/Mind-Link/test-chrome-138-apis.html"

# Check model status
Start-Process "chrome.exe" -ArgumentList "chrome://on-device-internals/"

# Open extensions page
Start-Process "chrome.exe" -ArgumentList "chrome://extensions/"
```

## 🎯 Expected Timeline

| Time | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Now** | Model is downloading (~1.5-2 GB) |
| **5-30 min** | Model download completes |
| **After download** | APIs become accessible in EPP profile |
| **Test phase** | Verify APIs work in test page |
| **Load extension** | Test all features in real usage |
| **Success!** | Extension fully working with Chrome AI! 🎉 |

---

## 🚀 What to Tell Me Next

Once the model finishes downloading, **run the test** and tell me:

1. ✅ "Model is Ready" - from chrome://on-device-internals/
2. ✅ "self.ai is true" - from test page
3. ✅ "Test buttons work" - Prompt API and Summarizer work
4. ✅ "Extension loaded" - No errors in chrome://extensions

Then we can test all the features together!

---

## 💡 Key Points to Remember

1. **EPP enrollment gives you early access** to experimental APIs
2. **APIs only work in the EPP-enrolled profile** (not other profiles)
3. **Model must be "Ready"** before APIs are accessible
4. **Your extension is already migrated** and ready to use
5. **All code is Chrome AI native** - no generic Gemini API anymore

---

**You're almost there! Just waiting for that model to download! 🎉**

Let me know when it's ready and we'll test everything!
