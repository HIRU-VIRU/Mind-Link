---

## üí° **Last-Minute Tips**

### If You're Running Out of Time:
1. **Prioritize the video** - it's 80% of your score
2. **Cut features if needed** - 3 APIs done well > 4 APIs done poorly
3. **Use AI voice** - faster than recording yourself
4. **Simplify graphics** - plain text overlays work fine
5. **Skip polish** - "good enough" beats "perfect but late"

### If Something Breaks:
1. **Stay calm** - you have backup files
2. **Revert to last working version** - git is your friend
3. **Simplify the demo** - show what works, skip what doesn't
4. **Be honest** - judges appreciate transparency

### On Submission Day:
1. **Submit early** - don't wait until last minute
2. **Test everything twice** - click all your links
3. **Have a friend test** - fresh eyes catch errors
4. **Save confirmation** - screenshot submission success
