## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### **For Hackathon Judges:**
These sites are **intentionally malicious-looking** for demonstration purposes. They include:
- Fake phishing indicators (for AI detection testing)
- Hidden subscription traps (to show summarization/analysis)
- Complex legal text (to demonstrate simplification)

**No actual data is collected.** All forms have `onsubmit="return false"` to prevent submission.

### **Safety Disclaimers:**
Each test site includes a disclaimer at the bottom:
> "‚ö†Ô∏è This is a FAKE site for demo purposes only ‚ö†Ô∏è"

This ensures:
- Users know it's a test environment
- No accidental data entry
- Clear educational purpose

### **Ethical Considerations:**
- These sites are for **testing/education only**
- Never use for actual phishing
- Never deploy on public internet without clear warnings
- Only use in controlled demo environments
