## 📞 **Final Thoughts**

This isn't about having the best code.
This isn't about using the most APIs.
This isn't about the most features.

**This is about telling a story that judges remember.**

Your story:
> "Elderly users lose billions to scams every year. Traditional security tools fail them. PhishGuard Vision uses Chrome's Built-in AI to create an intelligent safety shield that protects them - privately, automatically, and for free. Meet Sarah, who almost lost $50,000 to a fake PayPal site. PhishGuard Vision saved her."

That story, told well, **wins hackathons**.

Now go tell it. 🎬
