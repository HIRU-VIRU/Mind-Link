# ðŸŽ¯ FINAL FIX APPLIED - Extension Ready!

## âœ… What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Duplicate Code in summarize.js
**Problem:** File content was duplicated causing syntax error
**Fix:** Restored clean version from git

### Issue 2: AI APIs Not Available in Service Worker  
**Problem:** Background service workers don't have access to `LanguageModel` API
**Fix:** Changed api.js to run in MAIN world (has direct access to page APIs)

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

1. **manifest.json**
   - Added api.js to run in "MAIN" world
   - Separated into two content script blocks

2. **content/api.js**
   - Removed background service worker approach
   - Now uses direct `LanguageModel` and `Summarizer` APIs
   - Runs in MAIN world context (same as the page)

3. **content/summarize.js**
   - Restored clean version without duplication

## ðŸš€ How to Test

1. **Reload Extension:**
   ```
   chrome://extensions/ â†’ Click reload on "Mind-Link"
   ```

2. **Visit a webpage:**
   ```
   https://example.com or https://wikipedia.org
   ```

3. **Double-click any word** - Should show AI definition!

4. **Check console (F12):**
   Should see:
   ```
   [Mind-Link] Chrome AI APIs availability: {
     LanguageModel: true,
     Summarizer: true,
     ...
   }
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Works

**MAIN World Scripts:**
- Run in the same context as the page
- Have direct access to `LanguageModel`, `Summarizer`, etc.
- Can use the AI APIs directly (no message passing needed)

**Content Scripts (Isolated World):**
- Can't access page globals like `LanguageModel`
- Can still use `window.__notesio_api` to call the MAIN world functions

## âœ… Expected Result

All features should now work:
- âœ… Dictionary (double-click word)
- âœ… Summarization
- âœ… Phishing detection
- âœ… Ad learning
- âœ… Jargon simplification
